This is my repository which contains C code for different examples from CFD books. I will keep updating it as and when I make changes to the code. The goal here is to learn C programming and at the same time learn about the mathematical formulations specific to CFD, implementation of boundary conditions and different coupling algorithms.

I am using Library for Iterative Solver for Linear Systems(https://www.ssisc.org/lis/index.en.html) as my linear solver library.

At the end of every source file name there is an abbareviation which stands for the name of the book. 

Current status: I am going through the theory side of Finite Volume Method on unstructured meshes. It will take some time before I make my first commit with emphasis on stead-state diffusion equation.
